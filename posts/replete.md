Replete 2.0 is finally here! ClojureScript REPL for mobile devices, originally made for iOS by [Mike Fikes](https://mobile.twitter.com/mfikes), has landed version 2.0 with Android port and new functionality. Mike put together documentation website [replete-repl.org](http://replete-repl.org/) where you can learn more about new namespaces for doing file & network I/O. With help of clojurian [@\_\_tosh](https://mobile.twitter.com/__tosh) we even made it to the front [page on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19471879) and got a nice [post on Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/replete-2-0).

Replete is free and [open source](https://github.com/replete-repl). Get it for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/replete/id1013465639?ls=1&mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fikesfarm.Replete).
